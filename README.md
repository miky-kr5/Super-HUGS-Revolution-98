Compilation for Android
-----------------------

Super HUGS Revolution 98 depends on Python 2.7, Pygame, and pgs4a 0.9.4. Your
Python installation must have support for SQLite 3.

To compile Super HUGS Revolution for Android devices you need a
working instalation of Pygame Subset for Android (pgs4a) by
Tom Rothamel and Patrick Dawson. pgs4a can be
found at the following link:

    http://pygame.renpy.org/

Follow this steps to compile the game (instructions for GNU/Linux systems):

    1) cd to the pgs4a directory.
    2) Execute "./android.py configure Super-HUGS-Revolution-98".
    3) Answer the questions that will appear on the terminal. Press enter
       to use the default answers (between brackets []).
    4) Execute "./android.py build Super-HUGS-Revolution-98 release".

This will produce an installable .apk file inside the bin directory of pgs4a.
Compiling on Windows systems is similar.

To install Super HUGS Revolution on an Android device, use adb:

    adb install Super-HUGS-Revolution-98-X.Y.apk
